An open source chromium-based extension, Which helps you replace your default new tab with a better and simple one.
## How is this different?

**Idiono** is not just like the default new tab but more. We made it simple, easy-to-use, and similar to the default new tab for users to get familiar with it quickly. Not only shortcuts to navigate, search bar with different search engines, clock on the top but also featuring built-in pomorodo for productivity. As all chromium-browser use different default tabs, Idiono makes it the same everywhere. All your data is secured in your browser and we can't send this information anywhere.

> Simple, To the point and Open source *is our promise.*
